### This module is no longer in active development. We only plan to fix bugs or problems introduced by new foundry versions. If anyone want's to fork this module and add any features, feel free, you have our blessings.
A chat 'bot' for FoundryVTT that's full of 'happy' and 'motivational' messages, to pick you up when your rolls let you down. 


# Installation
Like any other module, you dummy. Just go in the `Add-on Modules` section and click `Install Module`, if you don't find me there, use this link: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmarian/sadness-chan/master/src/module.json

# Usage
Just play as you would usually do and Sadness Chan will send you 'happy' whispers if anything noteworthy happens.

But if you need more help just type `!sadness help` in the chat, and I will give you some more instructions.

### In case you are too special for any of my default settings, you can just change them, I guess...

### You can also modify all my 'cute' messages if any of them are too spicy for you `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Available templates:
- `[sc-name]`: name of the user that made the roll
- `[sc-avg]`: average rolled value by the user, rounded up to the nearest integer.
- `[sc-d<x>]`: number of rolled `<x>`. For example, `[sc-d20]` is the number of natural 20s, while `[sc-d1]` is the number of natural 1s.

# Disclaimer
This module is a joke, and should be treated as such.
